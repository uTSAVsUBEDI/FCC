          <h1>Introduction</h1>
        </header>
        <p class="description">Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes
          software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
          An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.<br><br>

          OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them.
          This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. <br> <br>

          The organization of an object-oriented program also makes the method beneficial to collaborative development,
          where projects are divided into groups. <br><br>

          Some of the terminologies of OOP are:

          <ul>
            <li>
              <span "list-topic">Class</span> − A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class.
              The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.
            </li> <br>
            <li>
              <span class="list-topic">Instance</span> − An individual object of a certain class.
              An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.
            </li> <br>
            <li>
              <span class="list-topic">Method</span> − A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.
            </li> <br>
            <li>
              <span class="list-topic">Object</span> − A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class.
              An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.
            </li>
          </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="Class_and_Objects">
        <header >
          <h2>Class and Objects</h2>
        </header>
        <p class="description">A class is a blueprint for the object. We can think of class as a sketch of a parrot with labels.
           It contains all the details about the name, colors, size etc. Based on these descriptions, we can study about the parrot.
           Here, a parrot is an object. <br> <br>The example for class of parrot can be :</p>
        <code>
          <p class="code">class Parrot: <br>&nbsp &nbsp pass</p>
        </code>

        <h2>Object</h2>
        <p class="description">An object (instance) is an instantiation of a class. When class is defined,
          only the description for the object is defined. Therefore, no memory or storage is allocated.
          <br><br>The example for object of parrot class can be:</p>
        <code>
        <p class="code">obj = Parrot()</p>
      </code>
        <h3>Example of Class and Objects</h3>
        <code><p class="code">class Parrot:<br>
          &nbsp &nbsp # class attribute <br>
          &nbsp &nbsp species = "bird" <br>
          &nbsp &nbsp # instance attribute <br>
          &nbsp &nbsp def __init__(self, name, age): <br>
              &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp self.name = name <br>
              &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp self.age = age <br><br>

          # instantiate the Parrot class <br>
          blu = Parrot("Blu", 10) <br>
          woo = Parrot("Woo", 15)</p></code>

          <p class="description">In the above program, we created a class with the name Parrot.
            Then, we define attributes. The attributes are a characteristic of an object.<br>
          <br>
        Then, we create instances of the Parrot class. Here, blu and woo are references (value) to our new objects.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Methods">
        <header >
          <h2>Methods</h2>
        </header>
        <p class="description">Methods are functions defined inside the body of a class.
          They are used to define the behaviors of an object.</p>
        <h3>Creting Methods in Python</h3>
        <code><p class="code">class Parrot:<br><br>

            &nbsp &nbsp # instance attributes <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp def __init__(self, name, age): <br>
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp self.name = name <br>
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp self.age = age <br><br>

            &nbsp &nbsp # instance method <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp def sing(self, song): <br>
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp return "{} sings {}".format(self.name, song) <br><br>

            &nbsp &nbsp def dance(self): <br>
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp return "{} is now dancing".format(self.name) <br><br>

        &nbsp &nbsp # instantiate the object <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp blu = Parrot("Blu", 10) <br><br>

        &nbsp &nbsp # call our instance methods <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp print(blu.sing("'Happy'")) <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp print(blu.dance())</p></code> <br>

        <p class="description">In the above program, we define two methods i.e sing() and dance().
          These are called instance methods because they are called on an instance object i.e blu.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Inheritance">
        <header >
          <h2 class="">Inheritance</h2>
        </header>
        <p class="description">Inheritance is a way of creating a new class for using details of an existing class without modifying it.
          The newly formed class is a derived class (or child class).
          Similarly, the existing class is a base class (or parent class).</p>
        <h3>Example of Inheritance</h3>
        <code><p class="code"># parent class <br>
          class Bird: <br><br>

              &nbsp &nbsp def __init__(self): <br>
              &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp print("Bird is ready")<br><br>

              &nbsp &nbsp def whoisThis(self): <br>
                  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp print("Bird") <br><br>

              &nbsp &nbsp def swim(self): <br>
                  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp print("Swim faster")<br><br>

          # child class <br>
          class Penguin(Bird): <br><br>

              &nbsp &nbsp def __init__(self): <br>
                  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp # call super() function <br>
                  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp super().__init__() <br>
                  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp print("Penguin is ready") <br><br>

              &nbsp &nbsp def whoisThis(self): <br>
                  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp print("Penguin")<br><br>

              &nbsp &nbsp def run(self): <br>
                  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp print("Run faster")<br><br>

          peggy = Penguin()<br>
          peggy.whoisThis()<br>
          peggy.swim()<br>
          peggy.run()</p></code>
          <p class="description">In the above program, we created two classes:
            <ul>
              <li>Bird</li>
              <li>Penguin</li>
            </ul>
            The child class inherits the functions of parent class. We can see this from the swim() method. <br>
            Again, the child class modified the behavior of the parent class. We can see this from the whoisThis() method.
            Furthermore, we extend the functions of the parent class, by creating a new run() method.</p>

          <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
        </header>

        <p class="description">
          <ul>
            <li>Using OOP in Python, we can restrict access to methods and variables.
            This prevents data from direct modification which is called encapsulation.</li>
            <li>In Python, we denote private attributes using underscore as the prefix i.e single _ or double __.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
        <h3>Example of Encapsulation</h3>

        <code><p class="code">class Computer: <br><br>

              &nbsp &nbsp  def __init__(self): <br>
                  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  self.__maxprice = 900 <br>

                &nbsp &nbsp def sell(self): <br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp print("Selling Price: {}".format(self.__maxprice)) <br><br>

                &nbsp &nbsp def setMaxPrice(self, price): <br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp self.__maxprice = price <br><br>

            c = Computer() <br>
            c.sell() <br><br>

            # change the price <br>
            c.__maxprice = 1000 <br>
            c.sell() <br> <br>

            # using setter function <br>
            c.setMaxPrice(1000) <br>
            c.sell()</p></code>

            <p class="description">In the above program, we defined a Computer class. <br>
              <ul>
                <li>We used __init__() method to store the maximum selling price of Computer. We tried to modify the price.
                However, we can't change it because Python treats the __maxprice as private attributes.</li>
                <li>As shown, to change the value, we have to use a setter function i.e setMaxPrice()
                which takes price as a parameter.</li>
              </ul>

          <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
        </header>
        <p class="description">Polymorphism is an ability (in OOP) to use a common interface for multiple forms (data types). <br>

                Suppose, we need to color a shape, there are multiple shape options (rectangle, square, circle).
                However we could use the same method to color any shape. This concept is called Polymorphism</p>
        <h3>Example of polymorphism</h3>
        <code><p class="code">class Parrot: <br> <br>

                  &nbsp &nbsp def fly(self): <br>
                      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp print("Parrot can fly") <br><br>
